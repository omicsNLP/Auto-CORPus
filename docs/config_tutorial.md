# How to create/edit a config file

For instructions on how to submit your own configs or make changes to existing config files please see [submit/update](#submitting-and-editing-config-files)

*The [config_pmc.json](https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus/blob/main/autocorpus/configs/config_pmc.json) file is used as the example in this tutorial.*

There are no required sections within the config file, if you do not define a section then Auto-CORPus will not try to process it.
Auto-CORPus will also not try to process any sections defined within the configs which are not within our template config file,
so we recommend starting from the template config file or a working config file and modify from there.

For each section in a publication, the config declares `data` and `defined-by` entities.

```json
{
    "section":{
        "defined-by":[],
        "data":{}
    }
}
```

The `defined-by` entity provides a list of HTML tags and attributes which Auto-CORPus can utilise to find occurrences of the
section within the source HTML. Each section must contain a `defined-by` entity.

```json
{
    "section":{
        "defined-by":[
            {
                "tag":"",
                "attrs":""
            }
        ],
        "data":{}
    }
}
```

The `data` entity allows HTML tags and attributes for areas of interest within
the defined section to be defined. This could be the title of a table or the heading of a section. Some of these `data` elements
are required to allow Auto-CORPus to accurately parse the source HTML whereas others are optional to allow the user to parse extra information from certain sections if provided by a HTML source. Further details about the `data` elements can be found in [data_elements.md](data_elements.md).

```json
{
    "section":{
        "defined-by":[],
        "data":{
            "title":[
                {
                    "tag": "",
                    "attrs": ""
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The `data` entity is an object and the object entries are lists of objects
whereas `defined-by` is a list of objects.

When providing multiple objects in `defined-by` or within a `data` element there will be a logical OR
between the objects meaning that the source HTML need only match
one of the provided `tag`/`attrs` pairs.

Each `defined-by` or `data` element list object can contain a `tag` and an `attrs` entry. The `tag` entry defines the HTML tag used to denote the section. The `attrs` entry is used to pass in HTML attributes which can uniquely identify
this section from others.

```json
            {
                "tag": "div",
                "attrs": {"class": ["ref-cit-blk"]}
            }
```

The above example tells Auto-CORPus to look for all `<div>` tags with a class of "ref-cit-blk". "ref-cit-blk" is denoted as a JSON list.  The use of a list allows other classes to be defined, that when used in combination, uniquely identify a section.  Hence, the logical AND operator is applied to these values.

Regular expressions can be used within the `tag` entry value and `attrs` entry values.
Auto-CORPus will automatically enclose any `tag` and `attrs` entries with the regex start (`^`) and end (`$`) anchors, this is to ensure there are no
erroneous matches. In [config_pmc.json](https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus/blob/main/configs/config_pmc.json), article sections are defined using the below `attrs`:

```json
"attrs": {"class": "sec"}
```

Without the inclusion of the start and end anchors, Auto-CORPus would also find matches to classes such as "tsec" and
"sectionTitle".  To ensure that all desired matches are found, ensure that the value entered describes the whole of the
`tag` or `attrs` value from the source HTML and not just part of it.

Below are two further examples of how this regex approach can be used:

```json
            {
                "tag": "p",
                "attrs": {"id": "_{0,2}p\\d+"}
            },
            {
                "tag": "h[3-6]"
            }
```

The first example looks for all `<p>` tags where the id looks something like `__p1` or `p12`. This is to allow for variability within how
the HTML is generated from each source without having to define exact matches for every possible format used.

The second example identifies all `header` elements ranging from `<h3>` to `<h6>`. Auto-CORPus will process all matching
headers at the same time.

Within the first example, notice the use of "\\\d" instead of the usual "\d" for identifying any digit. This is due to the regex pattern being defined within the config which is a JSON file. For further information about escaping special characters within JSON have a look at [this guide by tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json_simple/json_simple_escape_characters.htm).

## Submitting and editing config files

To submit a new config file or edit an existing one, please follow these instructions:

1) Fork the repo.
2) Make any changes and/or new configs within your fork.
   1) If creating a new config file, add yourself as the author within the `contributions` section of the JSON file.  If editing a pre-existing config file, include yourself as an editor within the `contributions` section.
   2) The comments section can be used to provide any additional relevant information about you and/or the edits made.
   3) Please provide an example source HTML URL that can be used to test the config file.
3) Create a pull request
4) We will approve the pull request once the config has been tested
