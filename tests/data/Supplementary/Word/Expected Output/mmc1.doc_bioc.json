In this report, we describe a multidrug-resistant tuberculous retropharyngeal abscess in a 21-year-old female patient who was treated for lymph node TB for one year. CT scan revealed a large retropharyngeal abscess that was aspirated intraorally under local anesthesia.  The diagnosis of TB was retained by molecular and histological study. GeneXpert MTB/ RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA),performed on the pus, showed rifampicin resistance and a first- and second-line drug resistance test using Genotype MTBDRplus VER.2 and MTBDRsl VER.1 (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) showed TB highly resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, and aminoglycosides.  Treatment is primarily medical as it combines specific antituberculous antibiotics, and aspiration for drainage of the abscess. Our patient was put on long-term 2nd line anti-TB treatment. ",

In response to this rifampicin resistance, we performed other molecular tests, including GenoType MTBDRplus VER. 2 and GenoType MTBDRsl VER.1 (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) on the pus to confirm rifampicin resistance and also to investigate resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It should be noted that this technique is not validated on extrapulmonary specimens directly, although many studies have showed a good correlation with the usual resistance screening methods.

The success of the treatment is related to the number of effective molecules still available [7]. However, high mortality has been observed in patients with XDR-TB and HIV infection. This could be explained by its synergistic relationship with TB and the emergence of MDR and XDR strains [7]. The HIV serology of our patient is negative which could further improve the prognosis of her disease.",
